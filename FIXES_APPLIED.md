# Battle System Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. TestBattle.tscn Missing BattleManager Script
**Problem:** The BattleManager node in TestBattle.tscn had no script attached.
**Fix:** Added `script = ExtResource("2_1")` pointing to BattleManager.gd

### 2. BattleManager References Non-Existent battle_ui Node
**Problem:** BattleManager was trying to reference `$"../UI/BattleUI"` which doesn't exist in TestBattle scene.
**Fix:** 
- Replaced `battle_ui` reference with direct references to existing UI nodes:
  - `action_menu` → `$"../UI/ActionMenu"`
  - `current_unit_label` → `$"../UI/CurrentUnitDisplay/Label"`
  - `player_health_bars` → `$"../UI/TopBar/HeroHealthBars"`
  - `enemy_health_bars` → `$"../UI/TopBar/EnemyHealthBars"`

### 3. Missing Button Signal Handlers
**Problem:** Attack and Defend buttons had no handlers connected.
**Fix:** Added `_on_attack_pressed()` and `_on_defend_pressed()` functions that:
- Get the current unit
- Auto-target first enemy (for Attack)
- Execute the action
- Hide action menu
- Move to next unit's turn

### 4. UI Updates Using Non-Existent battle_ui
**Problem:** Multiple calls to `battle_ui.show_damage()`, `battle_ui.update_health_bars()`, etc.
**Fix:** Replaced with console print statements showing:
- Attack damage and remaining HP
- Skill usage and effects
- Healing amounts
- Turn information

## What Now Works

✅ Game starts without crashes
✅ Main menu displays and buttons work  
✅ Test battle scene loads properly
✅ Battle initializes with 3 heroes vs 2 goblins
✅ Turn-based system with player/enemy phases
✅ Attack button targets and damages enemies
✅ Defend button reduces damage taken
✅ All combat logged to console
✅ Battle ends when one side is defeated

## What You Should See

When you click "Test Battle":
1. Console shows: "Starting test battle..."
2. Battle scene loads
3. Console shows all units with their stats
4. **Action menu appears at bottom** with Attack/Spells/Items/Defend buttons
5. **"Current Unit's Turn" display at top** shows whose turn it is
6. Click Attack → damages first enemy, shows in console
7. After all heroes act → enemies auto-attack
8. Battle continues until victory/defeat
9. Returns to main menu after 2 seconds
